I hold a PhD from the U. of Barcelona on advanced spectroscopic characterization of PV materials and devices with ML and XAI. 
I am fascinated by the integration of AI and ML into materials engineering and fundamental research, and how these tools
can improve our understanding of this strange world we live in. Other professional interests include bifacial PV technology,
soiling and degradation of PV devices, and research acceleration through AI and ML. I am a strong believer and advocate
for open source and open access to science and knowledge. For more information about me, means of contact, full list of
publications and conferences please check my CV and links above.
