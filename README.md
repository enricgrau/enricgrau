I am a PhD candidate at the University of Barcelona with focus on advanced spectroscopic characterization of 
PV materials and devices with ML and XAI. I am fascinated by the integration of AI and ML into materials 
engineering and fundamental research, and how these tools can improve our understanding of this strange world 
we live in. Other professional interests include bifacial PV technology, soiling and degradation of PV devices,
and research acceleration through AI and ML. I am a strong believer and advocate for open source and open access to
science and knowledge. For more information about me, means of contact, full list of publications and conferences
please check my CV and links above.
