I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Barcelona with focus on advanced spectroscopic characterization of 
PV materials and devices with ML applications. I am fascinated on the integration of AI and ML into materials 
engineering and fundamental research, and how this tools can improve our understanding of this strange world 
we live in. Other professional interests include bifacial PV technology, soiling and degradation of PV devices,
research acceleration through AI and ML, and ML explainability. I am a strong believer and advocate for open 
source and open access in science and knowledge. More information about me and all the means for contact on 
the links above.
